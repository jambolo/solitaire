# Solitaire

### A collection of solitaire games written in CoffeeScript and React.

## Tips

* The menu to do all kinds of things is the black menu button in the top right.
  * Use the Rule Help button after starting a game you've never played to learn how to play.
  * There is a Toggle Fullscreen button in there (if the browser supports it).
  * It even has unlimited Undo in there!
* The Hard Mode switch is for the next game only, and does not change the difficulty of the current game on the fly.
  * You can always see the current game/difficulty in the bottom right.
* Spiderette and Golf on Easy mode tends to be the easiest games to play/win,
  whereas Klondike and Spider (especially on Hard Mode!) are quite hard.
